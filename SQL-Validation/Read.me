SQL Validation – Data Migration Testing

This folder contains real-world SQL validation examples used during data migration testing for enterprise CRM systems. The queries demonstrate how data is validated at the database level to ensure accuracy, completeness, integrity, and consistency between legacy source systems and target CRM platforms.

SQL validation plays a critical role in migration testing, particularly when dealing with large data volumes, complex relationships, and business-critical information such as customer, financial, and historical records.
