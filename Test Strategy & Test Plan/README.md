Test Strategy vs Test Plan — Overview

This repository contains sample Test Strategy and Test Plan documents that demonstrate structured, risk-based quality assurance practices used in enterprise and government delivery environments.
These artefacts reflect industry best practice and showcase how testing is planned, governed, and executed to ensure high-quality, reliable, and business-ready software solutions.

Test Strategy — Overview

A Test Strategy is a high-level, project-independent document that defines the overall approach to testing across a program, platform, or organisation. It sets the direction for how quality will be managed and provides a common framework for all testing activities.

The Test Strategy typically covers:

Overall testing objectives and quality goals
Types of testing to be performed (e.g. functional, integration, regression, UAT, automation)
Test environments and data approach
Automation strategy and continuous testing principles
Defect management and quality governance
Risk-based testing approach
Roles and responsibilities
Entry and exit criteria at a high level
Integration with Agile and CI/CD delivery models
The Test Strategy ensures consistency, alignment with business objectives, and a shared understanding of how quality will be achieved across delivery teams.

Test Plan — Overview

A Test Plan is a detailed, project-specific document that defines how testing will be executed for a particular release, project, or phase. It translates the Test Strategy into an actionable plan tailored to the scope and risks of the specific initiative.

The Test Plan typically includes:

Test scope and out-of-scope items
Detailed test approach and phases
Test schedule and milestones
Test environments and data requirements
UAT planning and business involvement
Resource and responsibility allocation
Test deliverables and reporting
Defect management process
Entry and exit criteria for each test phase
Risks, assumptions, and dependencies

The Test Plan provides clear operational guidance to ensure testing is executed in a controlled, transparent, and effective manner.
