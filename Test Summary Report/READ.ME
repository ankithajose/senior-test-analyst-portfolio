Test Summary Report (TSR) — Overview

This repository contains a sample Test Summary Report (TSR) that demonstrates how test outcomes are formally documented and communicated to stakeholders at the end of a test cycle or release.
The TSR provides a consolidated view of testing activities, quality status, and release readiness, enabling business and technical stakeholders to make informed go/no-go decisions.

Purpose of the Test Summary Report

The Test Summary Report is used to:
Provide a clear summary of all testing activities completed for a release
Communicate overall quality status and test coverage
Highlight key risks, defects, and outstanding issues
Support release and deployment decision-making
Provide traceability between testing outcomes and business requirements
Maintain an auditable record of test execution and quality assurance
