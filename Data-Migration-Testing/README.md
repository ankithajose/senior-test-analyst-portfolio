This folder demonstrates my hands-on experience in data migration testing for CRM Customer Service and Sales platforms. The samples are based on real project work where legacy system data was migrated into a new CRM solution, requiring careful validation of data accuracy, completeness, integrity, and business continuity.

Data migration testing is a critical activity in enterprise systems, as defects can directly impact customer records, financial data, reporting, and downstream integrations. My focus is on validating that migrated data supports real-world business processes and user journeys, not just record counts.

Scope of Data Migration Testing Covered:

Source vs target data validation
Field mapping verification
Mandatory field validation
Data transformation rules
Duplicate and data integrity checks
Record count reconciliation
Business-critical scenario validation
Post-migration sanity and smoke testing
