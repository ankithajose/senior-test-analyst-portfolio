This repository includes UAT examples that demonstrate my experience coordinating and leading business-led User Acceptance Testing (UAT) for the Brief Connect project, a business-critical digital solution supporting departmental briefing and correspondence workflows.

In this project, I played a key role in planning, coordinating, and facilitating structured UAT sessions with business stakeholders to ensure the solution met real-world operational needs and business expectations.

UAT Planning & Session Coordination

I was responsible for organising and managing UAT sessions by:
Scheduling and coordinating structured 2–3 hour UAT workshops with business stakeholders
Ensuring all participants had the correct system access, roles, and permissions prior to each session
Preparing realistic test scenarios and ensuring relevant, real-world test data was available for execution
Setting up workflows so records could be created, progressed, and handed off between users with different business roles
Business-Led Test Execution
During UAT sessions, I actively facilitated and supported business users by:
Guiding stakeholders through end-to-end business processes within the system
Explaining each user’s role and responsibilities within the workflow
Providing step-by-step support to help users execute test cases confidently
Ensuring records were created, updated, approved, and passed between different roles to fully validate real business processes
Test Case Management & UAT Support

To support effective UAT, I:

Created detailed UAT test cases aligned to business processes and acceptance criteria
Allocated test cases to business users and supported execution during sessions
Monitored progress and ensured full coverage of critical business scenarios
Defect, Feedback & Enhancement Management
I captured and managed all UAT outcomes by:
Logging all defects identified during UAT with clear reproduction steps and evidence
Capturing business feedback, suggestions, and improvement requests
Maintaining a consolidated UAT feedback and enhancements register
Reviewing the consolidated list with the core UAT team to confirm completeness and accuracy
Prioritisation & Delivery Coordination
Following UAT, I coordinated cross-team review and prioritisation by:
Working with business and UAT leads to validate and prioritise defects and enhancements
Presenting the consolidated list to the development team for technical review and effort estimation
Sharing estimates and prioritised items with the Project Manager and delivery team
Supporting release planning decisions based on business priority, budget, and delivery timelines



This approach ensured:

Strong business ownership of UAT outcomes
High confidence in production readiness
Clear traceability between business feedback and delivery decisions
Effective collaboration between business, QA, development, and project management teams
Reduced risk of missed requirements and production issues
